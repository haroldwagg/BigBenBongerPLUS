# Big Ben Bonger

This is a PHONEGAP App.

Plays Westminster Chimes every quarter hour. User can select whether to hear the default
Big Ben chimes or a Mantle  or Grandfather Clock.  User can also select which quarter-hour chimes
to ring. Settings are saved in localStorage.

I use it as a way to keep track of time while I'm programming.
Keeps me from getting engrossed at the computer -- then surprise, it's midnight.
It could be handy to somebody.

====== HOW THIS WORKS ======

IF LEFT IN FOREGROUND, the screen should never sleep and always display.
 
Press the square 'Minimize' icon to send this app into BACGROUND MODE.
Big Ben continue to chime regardless of other activity on the phone.
You can specify whether you want the app to bong when you are on a 
phonecall. If you set it up this way, you will hear Big Ben bong in
your earpiece. The person on the other end of the phone will not hear
Ben at all.

To exit the Bonger completely, you must use the "X" in the top right corner 
of the app. If the app is running in background mode, click the Big Ben icon. 
This will bring Big Ben back to foreground, so you can make changes to the
Settings or exit the app.
